>"I am pleased with our third quarter performance. We delivered strong revenue growth of 26% driven by the positive reception of our two product strategy and meaningful market demand for next-generation BI solutions. [...] With the official introduction of Qlik® Sense, we are well positioned to meet the needs of the expanded market we see for both guided analytics and governed self-service visualization." - <span style="color: #000000;">Lars Björk, CEO of Qlik</span>
Qlik released its <a href="Http://investor.qlik.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=877920">financial report for Q3</a> and I read that total revenue is up 26% compared to last year. Who wouldn't be happy with that figure?
