# ... the author Vegar 
Norwegian guy in my 40s, father of two boys and a girl, living in Sweden for over 20 years.   

I've been working with business intelligence and the products in the Qlik Data Analytics platform since 2010. Mainly [QlikView](https://www.qlik.com/us/products/qlikview) och [Qlik Sense](https://www.qlik.com/us/products/qlik-sense). I've been handling a variety of business intelligence projects and assignments over the years.

Today I'm working as a BI consultant at :ok_hand: [ViewBase](http://viewbase.se) in Uppsala. I am partly  a seniordeveloper and architecht working with many of ViewBase's most strategic customers; and partly responsible for the development and manintainance of [ViewBase branch specific BI solutions](https://viewbase.se/losning/). 

In addition to my in house and client assignments I am also a frequent participant, nicknamed [Vegar](https://community.qlik.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/25001), of the Qliks Community. I am one of the more active members with over 3000 postings. I February 2021 I was recognized by the Community for my efforts with a [Round of Applause](https://community.qlik.com/t5/Community-Corner/Round-of-Applause-February-2021/m-p/1781014/highlight/true#M12238),  I found it very flattering. 

The posts in this blog is my own thoughts and ideas an not neccessarily the thought and ideas of my employer.
